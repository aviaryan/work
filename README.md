# Showcase

[aviaryan.in/work/](http://aviaryan.in/work/)

My open source projects portfolio. Built with React.


## Dev

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Customizing

Edit [src/data/projects.js](src/data/projects.js) to customize the projects that are being displayed. 
That file contains a simple JavaScript JSON Object so it should be very easy to get started.


## Libraries Used

```sh
React
React-Router
Redux
GeoPattern
```

## Deployment

Run `yarn build` to generate bundle files with all the dependencies.
 
Then use the `deploy.sh` script to deploy them to `gh-pages` branch.
